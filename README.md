### Hi there 👋

- My name is Stefan, and I love coding in my free time :)
- I would call myself a FLOSS enthusiast as I really like the idea behind it :blush:
- My Pronouns can be found in my bio (right under my profile picture on the left side) 🏳️‍🌈

I am more active on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/2tefan), so if you want to check out most of my projects, you can find them there 😇

If you want to contact me, write me an [e-mail](mailto:me@2tefan.eu) :envelope:
